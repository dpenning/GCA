General Cellular Automata
-------------------------

This set of programs allow you to simulate cellular automatas. I will be expanding on the number of supported automatas as the project evolves. Right now, you can simulate CCA (cyclical cellular automata).

You can also make videos from the program. I used ffmpeg for the windows version, and avconv for the linux version, your experience may vary.
